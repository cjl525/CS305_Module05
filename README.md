# CS305 Module 5 Assignment README
We are developing a website that is a user friendly meal and grocery planning. It holds a large amount of recipes inside a Firebase database
along with user information to better track user favorite foods and trends. The user uses the large filtering feature to take into account allergies, dietary-restrictions,
favorite and hated ingredients, and much more to curate the right recipes for the user. Once the filter is set, the site will then feed recipes to the user one by one until
the desired amount of recipes are selected.
